## Content

This repository contains the implementation of the theory derived and presented in the paper "Stochastic stiffness identification and response estimation of Timoshenko beams via physics-informed Gaussian processes", published in the Journal of Probabilistic Engineering Mechanics.

A base example for the sensor placement optimization, stiffness identification and response prediction is provided in `TimoshenkoPIGP.m`.
